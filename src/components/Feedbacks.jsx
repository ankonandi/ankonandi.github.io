              Exoskeleton for Assisted Arm Movement
            </h3>
            <p className={styles.sectionSubText}>
              Developed an Exoskeleton for physiotherapy, enabling users to
              perform controlled arm movements for rehabilitation. Initially
              using EMG sensors to detect muscle signals, the system was pivoted
              to use a MPU9250 sensor for wrist-based control, allowing for more
              precise and user-friendly functionality. The system is powered by
              150kg/cm high-torque servos, ensuring effective arm movement
              assistance. Additionally, a dedicated mobile app was built,
              offering intuitive control and real-time monitoring of the
              exoskeleton's performance. The app allows users to adjust
              settings, track progress, and ensure a personalized rehabilitation
              experience. The project underwent multiple testing iterations,
              ensuring reliability and optimal performance.

            IIITH Marketplace
          </h3>
          <p className={styles.sectionSubText}>
            Built a marketplace platform for IIIT Hyderabad students, improving
            over cluttered WhatsApp groups where students previously bought and
            sold second-hand items without proper categories or search options.
            Introduced a unique feature allowing students to request deliveries
            of food, parcels, or any other items from the canteen or within
            campus to their hostels. Added a payment method using the seller's
            QR code, allowing payments to be made directly to the seller when an
            item is listed. This approach eliminated the hassle of gateway
            charges, as the amounts being dealt with are typically lower.
            Conducted user research to uncover key pain points, ensuring the
            platform was intuitive, fast, and solved the major hassles faced by
            the student community.
